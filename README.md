# hello-world
Just an[nd text]other repository (this time with a change to this line)

This is me learning a bit about git. Using it in Visual Studio is going to be a new challenge so I'll just start here. Going to avoid going to SourceForge but wow these things are similar but different. Kinda cool, but I'm so used to TFS I'm not sure how much I'll like this.
